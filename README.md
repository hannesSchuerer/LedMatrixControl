# LedMatrixControl
Controller for a led matrix with shift register

## Components used:
- 2x 8 bit shiftregister 74hc595
- 8 220kÎ© resistors
- 1 Led Matrix 8x8
- 1 Arduino Mega 2560 for prototyping
- A bunch of jumper wires
- 1 Breadboard also for prototyping
                
## MatrixController class: 
- The constructor needs the 4 pins of each shift register. You can find the pins in the datasheet of the74hc595 shiftregister.
- The init() function initializes the 8 pins and puts it in the right state. Just init it in the setup function of Arduino.
- The setLed() function needs a x and y position and the state of the led.
- The updateAll() function updates all bits that are safed in the shift register.
- The clearAll() function sets all pins of the register to 0.

## My next steps

- Designing a pcb board with 16x16 leds
- Get components
- Solder all together
